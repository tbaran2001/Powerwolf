    Sent from heaven, the seventh of creatures
    Beast of Gévaudan, for the wrath of God to come
    Came to sanction the mass and the preachers
    Hunted by hundreds and never to be caught
    Descent to wander, bring terror and take 'em all beyond
    To the Father and the Son came the beast of Gévaudan
    Terminator, a traitor, half wolf and half machine
    To the prior and the nun came the beast of Gévaudan
    A redeemer, believer, all fatal, mad and mean
    Beast of Gévaudan
    Beast of Gévaudan, Christ the force is on the run
    Meant to feast on the treason of liars
    Beast of Gévaudan, bring up Nemesis undone
    Send the mass of profane to hellfire
    Hunted by hundreds, all tempted to be fought
    Ascent like thunder to tear down the enemies of God
    To the Father and the Son came the beast of Gévaudan
    Terminator, a traitor, half wolf and half machine
    To the prior and the nun came the beast of Gévaudan
    A redeemer, believer, all fatal, mad and mean
    Beast of Gévaudan
    In the night no man can run from the beast of Gévaudan
    No escape from the fate of a martyr born in pain
    When all prayers said and done, tame the land of Gévaudan
    And the curse of the beast will remain
    To the Father and the Son came the beast of Gévaudan
    Terminator, a traitor, half wolf and half machine
    To the prior and the nun came the beast of Gévaudan
    A redeemer, believer, all fatal, mad and mean

      Venom of Venus, take us all for blind

      Never resist when your eyes inflame the wild
      Venom of Venus or a fairytale
      Sing of temptation when the sirens wail
      Out of our minds by the wonders you unveil
      Come blessed desire, bring us all to fail
      We are the cursed, we came from fire and ice
      We are the first to kill, the sinner for lies
      We are the blessed, we crave the venom of Venus for life
      All our life
      We are the sword, we tame the fire, the flame
      We hail the lord, we fear no rebel, no pain
      We are possessed, we have the venom of Venus in veins
      Venom of Venus inundate our veins
      Eradicate minds 'til only lust remains
      Set us ablaze like the wake of hurricanes
      Venom of Venus, lead us all astray
      Bring us the sin before the martyrs pray
      Let it begin by the dawn of our judgement day
      We are the cursed, we came from fire and ice
      We are the first to kill, the sinner for lies

      And in the eye of all the believing
      Lead us straight to the curse divine
      And by the time our hearts are healing
      Inject the poison in our minds
      We are the cursed, we came from fire and ice
      We are the first to kill, the sinner for lies

God and Satan by my side
And I'm haunted in the dark
Sacramentum of the wild
Evil born as human child
Seed of wolf and man we are

You are like the dead alive
And you seal the time you die
Hear the call behind the dark
You can hide and start to run
When the seventh night has come
And you realize the mark
Are you taken all alone?
Holy Christ in flesh and bone
Pray, the werewolves left the ark

See it's not a sermon, they can't call me back
And when the moon is high, we call the pack, we attack!

This is the night of the werewolves
Run for your life
This is the night
Never get out alive
This is the night of the werewolves
Run for your life
This is the night
Never get out alive

Like a rebel in the war
We have seen the night before
And we call the morning star
Are you frightened all the more?
You can't hide behind a door
Dead and sanctified you are

See I'm not a sacred victim in despair
And when the fever calls, the pack is there, so beware

This is the night of the werewolves
Run for your life
This is the night
Never get out alive
This is the night of the werewolves
Run for your life
This is the night
Never get out alive

This is the night of the werewolves
Run for your life

      Seven heads, seven demons, seven murders in the sky
      Take your fate in your hands, and so we rise up high
      Nighttime rebel, stand alone against the wind
      Nighttime rebel, break the holy sin
      Nighttime rebel, wake up in the night and let it begin
      Nighttime rebel, holy light against the dark
      Nighttime rebel, bear a holy heart
      Nighttime rebel, summon in the dawn and let me in
      In the ongoing darkness
      Where the sky in torn and belief has failed
      Be the guide, the pretender
      And invoke the drowning rain
      By the hand of an outlaw
      By the flaming sword and a headless fail
      Like a wolf, like a phantom
      To the cross bound nail by nail
      Seven hordes, seven daggers, in apocalyptic rain
      By the dawn we are fading, still denied, it's not too late
      Nighttime rebel, stand alone against the wind
      Nighttime rebel, break the holy sin
      Nighttime rebel, wake up in the night and let me in
      Nighttime rebel, before the sin
      In the curse after midnight
      When inferno born and the mask unveil
      Be the last, bent and broken, and denied the one to fail
      Nighttime rebel, holy light against the dark
      Nighttime rebel, bear a holy heart
      Nighttime rebel, summon in the dawn and let me in
      Nighttime rebel, pray and fight against the world
      Nighttime rebel, make the call be heard
      Nighttime rebel, wake up in the night and bring the sin

God gave you carnal lust?
So pray to get a hard-on

Now I want my resurrection
All my life for resurrection
All I want is resurrection now
Oh, ha, resurrection now

Prepare for going wild
The new messiah calling
The purgatory child
Before my flesh is fading
The virgin has a turn
The third of days we're climbing the point of no return

  I gotta tell you a story

  Can you recall him?

  He is a master of hiding and he left not a trace

      In the light of the morning we fall
      Confront the brave, the rebel we stalk
      When we came - When we saw
      - We conquered them all
      Blessed when we die, confessed not a lie
      In the still of the night we awake
      Don't dare to cry, when fever up high
      No escape - No break - Your life we will take
      Gone with the night
      When the unholy demons of dawn pray
      When the sunlight is dead we're reborn
      We are dead until dark -
      When the night is calling
      Dead until dark - And at midnight high
      Dead until dark - And at dawn we all will die
      We are dead until dark -
      When the saints are crawling
      Dead until dark - And the demons fly
      Dead until dark - We unite the bloodred sky
      Cursed by our fate, the undead crusade
      For the sanctum deep under your skin
      Raise up the blade, by night we invade
      For the last - Of times - The fight may begin
      Murder bizarre, nocturnal we are
      When we rise like the phantoms of dust
      Sent from the dead, we long for the red
      For in blood - In god - In heaven we trust
      Gone with the night
      When the unholy demons of dawn pray
      When the sunlight is dead we're reborn
      We are dead until dark -
      When the night is calling
      Dead until dark - And at midnight high
      Dead until dark - And at dawn we all will die
      We are dead until dark -
      When the saints are crawling
      Dead until dark - And the demons fly
      Dead until dark - We unite the bloodred sky
      Dead, dead, dead until dark
      Dead, dead, dead until dark
      Dead, dead, dead until dark
      In the night we are
      Dead, dead, dead until dark
      Dead, dead, dead until dark
      Dead, dead, dead until dark
      In the night we are

      Dead until dark dead until dark

      Pray the Lord your soul to take

      For the dawn of the final day
      For unlight to guide the way
      And God, take our hand
      Overhead where the demons die
      And the daylight blinds the eye
      Alone on the pyre we stand
      In the daytime seek to hide
      Till at sundown we unite
      To begin the sacrifice scream halleluja
      Ride the storm and raise your fist
      Celebrate the eucharist
      Go out in the night for we are...
      Wild, wild, we are the wild
      Wild, wild, break out and cry

      Bleed them of their lives
      Fresh blood on our swords
      Gods of War arise
      Sacrifice to Gods of old
      Bleed them of their lives
      Fresh blood on our swords
      Gods of War arise
      Hear the tortured screams
      Shattering the air
      They awake from soothing dreams
      Into their worst nightmare
      Fire sweeps their homes
      They feel the dragon's breath
      Consuming and destructive flames
      Agonizing death
      Some seek shelter in the church
      A refuge for those with faith
      But we know how to smoke them out
      A pyre will be raised
      But those who choose to stand and fight
      Will die with dignity
      For the unfortunate few who survive
      Waits a life in slavery
      The day draws to an end
      The night comes dark and cold
      We return to our ships
      With silver, slaves and gold
      We gave them agony
      As they fell and die
      The Gods have granted victory
      For our sacrifice
      The day draws to an end
      The night comes dark and cold
      We return to our ships
      With silver, slaves and gold

      Storms have gone and rain has fallen
      And all our wildest prayers have been said
      We will wait and we will guard you
      Alive or undead
      Worlds have come and worlds have fallen
      And after all the nights and blood we shed
      Still we bleed and we're undying
      Alive or undead
      We fell to dust and arose from the graves
      Ignored the signs of the end
      We dared to run with the wildest of wolves here we stand
      In rise and fall
      Praised the cross so many years
      The icon called
      Fought the sin and tears, father
      In those who are wild at heart believe
      Alive or undead
      Alive or undead
      Alive or undead
      Times of pain and times of craving
      And after all let ressurect the dead
      We will wait and we will save you
      Alive or undead
      We fell to dust and arose from the graves
      Ignored the signs of the end
      We dared to run with the wildest of wolves here we stand
      In rise and fall
      Praised the cross so many years

      Sunken and banned, no rest, no repent

      Faster, wider
      We come alive under fire
      Darker, wilder
